<p class="md-body-1">
  Throughout our DofE experience, we were planning to be observant to flora and fauna in the area.
  We have documented, recorded and researched many of the natural organisms we have found and the experience did not render underwhelming.
  In this webapp, we will show the variety of many of the plants and animals that we found throughout the Ashdown Forest and our comments upon them.
  Now click through the tabs located in the sidebar to progress.
